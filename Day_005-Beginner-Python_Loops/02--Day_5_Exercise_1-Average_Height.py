# Exercise 1 - Average Height

# You are going to write a program that calculates the average student height from a List of heights.
# The average height can be calculated by adding all the heights together and dividing by the total number of heights.
# Average height must be rounded to the nearest whole number.
# IMPORTANT: You should not use the sum() or len() functions in your answer.
# You should try to replicate their functionality using what you have learnt about for loops.

# Don't change the code below
student_heights = input("Input a list of student heights in cm separated with a space ").split()
for n in range(0, len(student_heights)):
    student_heights[n] = int(student_heights[n])
# print(student_heights)
# Don't change the code above

#Write your code below this row ðŸ‘‡

total_height = 0
for height in student_heights:
    total_height += height
print(f"total height = {total_height}")

number_of_students = 0
for student in student_heights:
    number_of_students += 1
print(f"number of students = {number_of_students}")
  
average_height = round(total_height / number_of_students)
print(average_height)
