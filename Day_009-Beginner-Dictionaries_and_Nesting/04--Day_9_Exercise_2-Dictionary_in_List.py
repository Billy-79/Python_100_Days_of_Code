# Exercise 2 - Dictionary in List

# You are going to write a program that adds to a travel_log. You can see a travel_log which is a List that contains 2 Dictionaries.
# Write a function that will work with the following line of code to add the entry for Russia to the travel_log.
# add_new_country("Russia", 2, ["Moscow", "Saint Petersburg"])
# You've visited Russia 2 times.
# You've been to Moscow and Saint Petersburg.
# DO NOT modify the travel_log directly. You need to create a function that modifies it.
