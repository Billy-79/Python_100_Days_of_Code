# Number Manipulation and F Strings in Python
# Exercise 3 - Life in Weeks

# Create a program using maths and f-Strings that tells us how many days, weeks, months we have left if we live until 90 years old.
# It will take your current age as the input and output a message with our time left in this format:
# You have x days, y weeks, and z months left.
# Where x, y and z are replaced with the actual calculated numbers.

# Don't change the code below
age = input("What is your current age? ")
# Don't change the code above

# Write your code below this line

years = 90 - int(age)
months = round(years * 12)
weeks = round(years * 52)
days = round(years * 365)

print(f"You have {days} days, {weeks} weeks, and {months} months left.")
