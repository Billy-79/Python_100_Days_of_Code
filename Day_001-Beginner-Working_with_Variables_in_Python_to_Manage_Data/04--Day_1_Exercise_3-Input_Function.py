# Exercise 3 - Input Function

# Write a program that prints the number of characters in a user's name. You might need to Google for a function that calculates
# the length of a string.
# WARNING: Your program should work for different inputs. e.g. any name that you input.

# This code prints the number of characters in a user's name.
print( len( input("What is your name? ") ) )

# Notes
# If input was "Jack"
# 1st: print(len("Jack"))
# 2nd: print(4)
